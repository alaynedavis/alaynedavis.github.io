                    <h3>PACKAGE REDESIGN</h3>

                    <p>The objective of this project was to find a piece of packaging from the store that was designed poorly and redesign it. This redesign focused fully on visual design and aesthetic, not the functionality of the packaging. The packaging I chose to redesign was a box of lavender chamomile tea bags from the brand Bigelow. To achieve this redesign, I used Adobe Illustrator to design each face of the box. Then, I found a premade photoshop mock up, and I put my designs on the mockup to display them realistically.</p>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>For this project, I created a made-up club based on a unique interest I have. I used to love making things with this toy called the Rainbow Loom when I was younger. If you don't know what the Rainbow Loom is, <a href="https://rainbowloom.com/"  target="_blank">click here</a> to visit the Rainbow Loom website. I decided to create a club for college students to get together and make things with the Rainbow Loom. I designed a flyer as well as buttons for the club on Adobe Illustrator in order to create a cohesive identity/brand.</p>

                <h3>LETTER</h3>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>I was assigned a random letter for this project, and I had to create a new typeface for that one character. I received the letter "R", so you can see the typeface I created for that letter below. After many handrawn sketches, I created this letter in Adobe Illustrator using the pen tool.</p>

                <h3>WORD</h3>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>The idea for this project was that I was supposed to create a word in Adobe Illustrator. However, the parameters were that it was supposed to be a wordmark for a show idea we came up with. I had the idea of creating a wordmark for a show about Greek mythology. The plot of the show is about the greek messenger god Hermes and his journeys to and from the underworld. Therefore, I decided to name this show Kathados, and the wordmark I designed for it is pictured below:</p>

                </div>

                <h3>LIST</h3>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>I was supposed to make some sort of list, but we were supposed to think of it more like a menu that is a list or assortment of offerings. Therefore, I decided to make a list (or menu) of quotes that my family often quotes. These quotes are sorted into categories whether they are from a movie, animation, or TV series. I created this completely on Adobe InDesign.</p>

                <h3>SYSTEM</h3>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>The last project in the progression of typography projects is a system. This was my favorite one to design out of all 4 projects. For the system, I was supposed to pick any typeface I wanted and create a type specimen book for it. As most type specimens, this system was meant to display many different ways the single typeface could be used and styled. I chose the typeface "American Typewriter" and that is the only typeface that is used in this entire book I created.</p>
